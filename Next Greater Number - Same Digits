Boundary Conditions:
1 <= N <= 99999999999999

Example Input/Output 1:
Input:
12

Output:
21

Example Input/Output 2:

195

Output:
519




my sol:

#include <iostream>
#include<vector> 
using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    int i,l,j,k,m;
    string s;
    cin>>s;   // getting the no. input in string to make calculation easy
    l=s.length();
    vector<int>a(l);
    for(i=0;i<l;i++){
        a[i]=s[i]-'0';//storing element in a vector
    }
    for(i=l-1;i>0;i--){
       
        for(j=i-1;j>=0;j--){
            if(a[i]>a[j]){        //first checking i th digit all previous higher order digits in order to fit that if it is the 
            case with 195 first we have to replace last element to the first that is 591.
                a[i]=a[i]+a[j]-(a[j]=a[i]);//swapping
                for(int k=j+1;k<l;k++){//hear we have obtained the 591 but we require 519 so we have to check from j+1 to l and 
                ascend them with order to get smallest no.
                    for(m=k+1;m<l;m++){
                        if(a[k]>a[m]){
                            a[k]=a[k]+a[m]-(a[m]=a[k]);//ascending them
                        }
                    }
                    
                }
                goto x;
            }
        }
    }
    x: for(i=0;i<l;i++){
        cout<<a[i];
    }
    return 0;
   }
   
   
  algorithm:
  consider 4841965, here we are comparing 5 with every previous digits until it gets the lesser value than 5. after finfing that
  just swapping that we may get as 4845961. then we have to arrange the values after 5 in ascending order in order to get lowest 
  nearest value 4845169. here there is no need to care about previous value of that 5, if we swap greater value after the 5, we 
  will reach lesser value than given(4548961) . if we swap lesser value than 5 we will reach to greatest value than we want
  (4854961). this is the basic idea behind the solution.
